PB&J on white bread?  
Been there.  Done that.  

How about Pb&J on TOAST?  That's right.  
Imagine the same savory and sweet classic sandwich we all have come to love, 
but with delicious, warm peanutbutter oozing out?  

You're in?  Easy.  
Toast two pieces of your favorite bread (skip the crusts), 
put peanut butter on BOTH sides, and then jelly.  
Cut in half.  
Enjoy.  

You're welcome and good night!
