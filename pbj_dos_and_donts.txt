For the perfect peanut butter & jelly sandwich:
Do:
-Use creamy peanut butter for easy spread
-Use proper peanut butter-to-jelly ratio: somewhere between 1:1 and 2:1 is ideal
-Cut sandwich in half (diagonally, of course)

Don't:
-Use stale bread--it's important to have right texture
-Use bland jelly--some great jellies can be found at country stores/farmers markets
-Eat PB&J without glass of milk or water
